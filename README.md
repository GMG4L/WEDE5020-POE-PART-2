# WEDE5020-POE-PART-2
I was so dissapointed with the marks that I recieved for my POE part 1, as I recieved lower than what I had expected of myself. Looking at my part 1 POE marks areas of improvement were evident, as it shows
that I mostly lost marks just beacause I failed to read instructions when I was working on it. For example I failed to attach my proposal, which made me lose majority of my marks as the rubric dished out a lot of marks for it,as it was a requirement. Than i also failed to initiate my commits with proper word structure which also deducted marks, I could have simply been alerted with all these expectation to my website if I simply had just read the rubric and followed pursuit.Even though I have failed to read instructions, my website design was exepctional and gained a lot of marks for it. But For this Part I made sure that all requirements have been covered this being including, commenting my code, making a style sheet page for my CSS, and all material that has been asked for I have tried to attend to.For My Part 2 I have implemented top tier CSS that has taken my website from one level to another, all my codes still come from the same sources on the internet. I have added new Image and buttons to my code . I have also extraordinatily improved my enquire page. I have high expentancy that my POE will 2x better than my part 1 as I will look through the rubric and read carefully of what is expected of my website
